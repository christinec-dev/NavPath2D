## Navpath2D
NavPath2D is a GUI-based tool designed to simplify the creation and management of navigation paths for 2D entities in Unity. It allows you to draw paths (that entities such as your AI should follow) directly in your Unity Editor scene. 

These paths can then be saved as prefabs and assigned to entities. These entities will then randomly select a path to move on, eliminating the need for complex A* pathfinding algorithms. 

This package is particularly suitable for simpler cases where detailed pathfinding is not required, offering a straightforward alternative to more complex solutions. You also have the flexibility to expand upon the basic functionality, making it adaptable to various genres and project requirements.
